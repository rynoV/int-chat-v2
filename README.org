#  LocalWords:  Firestore Firebase
* Goals
  - Rebuild the project starting with a TDD server.
    1. Set up a tested Hello World server-less function
       - Test Firestore
       - Test Apollo
* Testing
  - Don't forget to start the emulators for tests running Firebase code
  - An error like
    : FirebaseError: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED: false for 'update' @ L5
    means that an update operation was tried but the rules did not allow it.
    These can occur from ~firebase.assertSucceeds~ calls.
  - Remember to await expect calls using ~toDeny/toAllow~. If you don't those
    tests will pass every time.
